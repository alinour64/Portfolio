            <p>
              I am an undergraduate student perusing a Bachelor of Science
              degree in computer science. I take my academic learning very
              serious. My career goals are to design and implement machine
              learning algorithms and integrate these algorithms with data
              mining techniques to discover various data patterns. More
              specifically, I want to explore patterns in data that is streamed
              out of mobile and connected devices and these devices affect our
              daily lives. In my free time, I like to learn new programming
              languages and research upcoming technologies. I also volunteer at
              a youth organization and help youth connect with each other and
              develop social skills that would help them with their future. More
              specifically, I volunteer at the youth organization to promote
              STEM based education among the youth. During the weekends, I
              volunteer at a youth organization and help many youths develop
              social skills such as public speaking and to be comfortable around
              others. During our weekly meetings, we discuss many things such as
              careers, future goals, as well as just chatting together. We also
              introduce many STEM based topics to help open their eyes to career
              paths. We also host many workshops to give the youth some hands-on
              experience. One of my favorite workshops was a Microsoft .NET
              framework workshop. During this workshop, we developed a website
              where the youth can submit questions as well as answer quizzes as
              part of an online educational system.

        <h4>Computer Science</h4>
        <p>
          At the University of Washington I started taking programming class to
          further expand my knowledge in the computer science world. I also
          wanted to grasp the basic fundamentals of programming. Another very
          important goal I had at the University of Washington was to gain
          experience from previous computer science students as well as computer
          science professor.

          During my running start I took many elective to see which major I want
          to persue and I found that I really enjoyed programming and that
          programming will shape the future. That's when I started during my
          research on what it really means to be a computer science major and
          found out that computer science is my true passion.

              <p>
                In this project I explored the object oriented side of java and
                constructed a simple banking application. This banking
                application checks for invalid inputs as well as formats the
                output file so it is userfriendly. This application checks
                weather a purchase would cause the account to be in the negative
                and if so pervents the user form making that purchase. I learned
                alot about exception handeling, object oriented programming, and
                overriding while constructing this application. In the future I
                want to add a UI to this application.

              <h3>File Search</h3>
              <p>
                I designed and implemented another application, the file
                manager. This application runs a binary search on every folder
                in a directory and displays how many occurrences a certain file
                exists as well as the location of the files. This project tested
                my optimization skills because in the first run it would take a
                long time to find certain files. This was because the program
                had a time complexity of O(n^2). After implementing a binary
                search tree method to look for files, the time complexity was
                reduced to O(log n) which was significantly faster.

            <h3>MAP</h3>
            <p>
              I built an application that displays a map using Google Map’s
              cloud API. In this project I added functionality for driving,
              transit, biking, and walking. This application takes in a starting
              location as well as an ending location and displays the route
              according to which type of transportation is selected. This
              project also uses a geolocator to track the user and display where
              on the map the user is currently located. Additionally, there is
              route options that can be selected, like allowing tolls or ferries
              to alter which direction is selected.
